[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-4hrphh)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
For this problem will find all prime numbers up to the number you are given as a parameter and return their sum.  It is a good idea to research algorithms for finding prime numbers.

### REFERENCE LINKS
- [Prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)

## HINTS
### Hint 1
You can use the definition of [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) or try learning and implementing your own [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).  Check this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11966520/how-to-find-prime-numbers-between-0-100) to see a StackOverflow discussion on various ways of finding prime numbers.

### Hint 2
This problem can be hard if you create your own code to check for primes, so don't feel bad if you use someone's algorithm for that part.  Research is an important part of coding!
